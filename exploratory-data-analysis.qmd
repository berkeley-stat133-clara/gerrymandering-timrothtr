### Question 1

Which Races were the closest and which ones were blowouts?
```{r}
#| echo: false
district_results <- precinct_long |>
  filter(!is.na(candidate_name), race_type %in% c("Assembly", "Congress")) |>
  group_by(race_type, district, candidate_name, candidate_party) |>
  summarise(total_votes = sum(votes, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

race_margins <- district_results |>
  group_by(race_type, district) |>
  arrange(desc(total_votes), .by_group = TRUE) |>
  mutate(rank = row_number()) |>
  slice_head(n = 2) |>  # keep only top 2 per race
  summarise(
    margin = abs(diff(total_votes)),
    pct_margin = margin / sum(total_votes),
    winner = first(candidate_name),
    winner_party = first(candidate_party),
    loser = last(candidate_name),
    loser_party = last(candidate_party),
    total_votes = sum(total_votes),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  arrange(pct_margin)

race_margins |> 
  slice_head(n = 10) |>
  select(race_type, district, winner, winner_party, loser, loser_party, pct_margin, total_votes)
```

### Answer 1
```{r}
#| echo: false
library(scales)

race_margins |> 
  slice_head(n = 10) |>
  select(race_type, district, winner, winner_party, loser, loser_party, pct_margin, total_votes)

ggplot(race_margins, aes(x = pct_margin)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25, fill = "steelblue", color = "white", alpha = 0.85) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(0.05, 0.10), linetype = "dashed", color = "red", linewidth = 0.8) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1),
    limits = c(0, 1),
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Vote Margins by District (Assembly + Congress)",
    subtitle = "Vertical dashed lines mark 5% and 10% thresholds for competitive races",
    x = "Vote Margin (Share of Total Votes)",
    y = "Number of District Races"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "gray30"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```


### Question 2

Which party dominated across districts and and were their wins evenly distributed?

### Answer 2

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Identify winner for each district
winners <- district_results |>
  group_by(race_type, district) |>
  slice_max(total_votes, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE) |>
  ungroup()

# Summarize wins by party and race type
party_wins <- winners |>
  count(race_type, candidate_party) |>
  group_by(race_type) |>
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n))

# Plot: share of wins by party
ggplot(party_wins, aes(x = race_type, y = pct, fill = candidate_party)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack", color = "white") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("DEM" = "#2E74C0", "REP" = "#CB454A", "AIP" = "gray60", "Other" = "gray70")) +
  labs(
    title = "Party Distribution of District Wins (Assembly + Congress)",
    x = "Race Type",
    y = "Share of Districts Won",
    fill = "Party"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)
```


### Question 3

Are turnout rates correlated with competitiveness?

### Answer 3

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Aggregate turnout by district
turnout_by_district <- precinct_long |>
  group_by(race_type, district) |>
  summarise(turnout = mean(turnout_rate, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Merge with race margins
race_margins_turnout <- race_margins |>
  left_join(turnout_by_district, by = c("race_type", "district"))

# Plot relationship
ggplot(race_margins_turnout, aes(x = pct_margin, y = turnout)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "darkred") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Race Competitiveness and Voter Turnout",
    x = "Vote Margin (Proportion of Total Votes)",
    y = "Average Turnout Rate"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)
```
